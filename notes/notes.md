# Progamming skills

- For a set of variables defined in a class used for similar purpose, we can use `typedef` so that we can change their type easily.
- When loop up for documents, choose official references first(say cppreference) rather than blogs.		
- When using a type, consider the range of it, especially when using `unsigned`
  - For common attributes shared by all objects, define them as `static const`






# Basic Knowledge

- Use `<cstdint>` to specify the size.
